Forestry Dashboard
Description
The Forestry Dashboard is a data visualization and navigation tool developed to assist the city’s Forestry Department in managing urban forestry operations more effectively. This dashboard provides a centralized interface with real-time data and maps to help forestry staff, particularly the forestry officer, track, monitor, and manage the city's trees, conservation areas, and forestry resources.

Key Features
Interactive Map: Allows for detailed navigation of the city’s urban forest, showing tree locations, health status, species, and maintenance history.
Data Filters: Enables filtering based on tree species, health, age, and last maintenance date.
Maintenance Scheduling: A calendar and notification system to help track upcoming and overdue maintenance activities.
Analytics and Reporting: Provides insights into tree health, species diversity, coverage, and trends in forestry data.
Document Repository: Stores related documents, manuals, and reports for easy access.
